# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview of the Belly Button Biodiversity Plotly Project

Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. She knows that she wants to create engaging and dynamic charts. It is our task to identify the best way to share her information with her audience.
